          <p>COVID-19 has impacted our lives in ways we have never experienced before. Sometimes, we wonder if things will ever go back to the way
          it was before. These are difficult days, but with today's medical advancements, we can hope to find to cure sooner or later.</p>
          <br>
          <p>In the meantime, stay home and stay safe.</p>

            <i class="fas fa-head-side-cough fa-3x icon"></i>
           <p>COVID-19 spreads mainly by droplets produced as a result of coughing or sneezing of a COVID-19 infected person.</p>
             <br>
             <p>This can happen in two ways:
               <ul>
                 <li><b>Direct close contact:</b> one can get the infection by being in close contact with COVID-19 patients</li>
                 <li><b>Indirect contact:</b> the droplets survive on surfaces and clothes for many days. </li>
            </ul>
              <br>
                Therefore,touching any such infected surface and then touching oneâ€™s mouth, nose or eyes can transmit the disease.</p>

          <p>The impact of COVID-19 can be felt throughout the world-taking lives, destroying livelihoods, and changing everything about how we interact
             with each other and the world.</p>
          <br>
            <i class="fas fa-chart-area fa-5x icon"></i>
          <p>On the economic side, the aviation industry has been hit the hardest.
             Global trade is forcasted to drop by 27%. Poverty is expected to increase due to increase in unemployment.In the social front, the education of students has been  heavily compromised.</p>
           <br>
            <i class="fas fa-plus-square fa-5x icon"></i>
           <p>That's not to say everything is bad. For one, this is a big opportunity for the Indian economy by encouraging local businesses to improve the
             economy. This lockdown has also brought families together. The biggest positive has to be for the environment with
             wildlife rejuvenating and carbon levels reduce in the atmosphere for the first time in nearly 30 years</p>
            <br>
            <p>So,this lockdown can become a bit more bearable when we look at the positive impacts
             the COVID-19 pandemic has brought to India and the rest of the world!</p>
